## Prerequisites and Installation <a name="Prerequisites"></a>

The following libraries are required in order to run the project: Python, Spark, Pyspark, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project was made for an an Udacity Nanodegree project. The study focused on data from a fictional music service provider company named "Sparkify". Our aim was to create a model to predict the percentage of its subscribers who are going to cancel or stop renewing their services.

## Results <a name="Results"></a>
We have studied the sparkify mini dataset, cleaned and analysed the dataset and we came up with 9 features to use for our models. We compared the "Support Vector Machine" (SVM) versus the "Gradient Boosting Trees" (GBT) models and chose to utilise GBT to predict churn due to its perfect accuracy and F1 score of 0.99.
